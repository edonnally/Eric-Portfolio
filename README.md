# [Project 1: Movie Dataset Model- Project Overview](https://github.com/edonnally/Movie-Data-Analysis)
* Created a logistic regression model in R to predict the likelihood of producing a great movie using variables such as movie runtime, genre, budget, etc.
* Prepped data on 45k movies from the Full Movie Lens Dataset.
* Used dummy variables to break up genres into separate variables and determined which variables had the greatest impact on a movie's rating.
